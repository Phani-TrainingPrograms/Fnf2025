# About Angular
1. Angular is a framework of JS developed by Google for developing rich internet based applications in a faster, reliable and easy manner. It is developed in an optimized manner and make apps light weight and deployable on multiple devices. 
2. It is developed using various tools to make it light weight, faster and secured. These tools could be webpack, minify and Protractor. 
3. Developed by Google, has wide uage across the globe and a large community of developers to support. Google promises to give a new version very 6 months with more versetility, upgrades and backward compatibility. 
4. Angular has the following features:
    - It provides Component architecture where UR App is divided into small independent components which are reusable and adaptive. They are self contained units with little or no dependencies from other components. Every component comes with a code behind file, a html file for the view, a Testing file for Unit testing, a CSS file for styles. 
    - It is designed for Single Page Application development. There shall be a page called Index.html and all the components shall be placed inside this file directly or indirectly. 
    - It provides DI feature for the components using Services. Services are singleton objects that have functions that can be invoked from anywhere in the Application. 
    - Data Binding is a very important feature of Angular that makes it very attractive for the UI enhancements. They have 2 way binding as well as 1 way binding. Binding is required to bind the data(Variables) to the HTML controls and back and forth. 
    - Angular has support for Unit Testing and E2E Testing. Unit testing is done using Jasmine framework and E2E is done using Frameworks based on Selinium. 
    - Angular 5.0 or later came up with Routing feature which allowed components to be visible on requirement using links. 
    - Angular uses Typescript a programming language based on JS which is typesafe JS. It comes with a Compiler called Transpiller which internally converts UR TS code to JS code in an faster manner. The code is more typesafe and makes it faster in execution. 
    - With these features, Angular helps to develop Components(Fundamental units of UR App), Pipes(Transformers), Services(Singleton objects), Gaurds(Middleware), directives(attributes), interfaces, classes. All the above mentioned terms are based on classes with specific directives. 

    # Software requirements
    1. Any OS like Linux, Windows or iOS. 
    2. Download the LTS version of Nodejs. Nodejs is the web server for UR Angular app. 
    3. Angular CLI  for creating the Components of the App and also a boiler plate code for the App.
