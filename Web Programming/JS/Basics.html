        //Data types in JS are number, string, boolean, object. 
        //Data types are dynamic in nature. 
        //let, const and var are used to declare the variables in JS(ES6).
        //let and const was introduced in ES6 for better readability and powerfullness. 
        // const num = 123; //U cannot modify it. 
        // alert("The data type of num is " + typeof(num))
        // alert(num) 
        // let data = "Sample Text";
        // alert("The data type of data is " + typeof(data))
        // alert(data)
        // data = true;
        // alert("The data type of data is " + typeof(data))
        // data = { name : "Phaniraj", addres : "Bangalore" }
        // alert("The data type of data is " + typeof(data))
        ////////////////var vs. let//////////////////////
        //Older JS code used to declare variables using var. var is still available as a part of backward compatibility. 
        // let is scope based and very powerful compared to var. 
        let example = "Some Text";
        console.log(example);
        {
            let example = "Some more Text";
            console.log(example);
        }
        console.log(example);
        //replace var with let and note the differences. This is called Scoped based variables. let allows scope based variables. 
        ///////////////////undefined vs null////////////////////////////////////
        //if a variable is declared without assignment, then its called as undefined. 
        let apple;
        if(apple == undefined){//check for assignment. 
            console.log("The value is not set for apple" );
        }else{
            console.log(`The Value of apple is ${apple}`);
        }
        let apple123 = "apple 123" //value is assigned and is not undefined
        console.log(`The value of apple123 is ${apple123}`)
        //null is a state when an object is not filled with data. We usually set null for variables which will be set with objects that come from a return type of a function.  
            let obj = null;
            if (obj == null)
                console.log("Its null");
            else
                console.log("obj is not null");
          ////////////////////////== vs. ===/////////////////////////////////
          //=== is used for strict checking while == checks only the value. 
          const value = 123;
          if(value == "123")//checks the value
           console.log("They are same");
           if(value === 123)
             console.log("They are same in value as well as data type");
            else{
                console.log("Either the value or the type is mismatch")
            }
            /////////////////Conversion Example////////////////////////////
            //All inputs come to the App as strings. We can convert them to a number using parseInt and parseFloat functions. 
            let num1 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the First number"));
            let num2 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the Second number"));
